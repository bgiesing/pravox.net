<span class="moze-blockquote">&nbsp;“Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the possibility of failure.” -Saul Bass</span>

Failure... I have experienced lots of it on the journey of Pravox, yet it always gives me new ideas to make it better and learn from the past. That creativity is what inspired me to make this site and redo Pravox. Read on to see our new company/station logos and read about it's creative process.

# New Logo
![Pravox Networks Logo]({{site.logos}}logo.png)
Above is our new (and 1st) logo! Inspired by Google's Material Design, it showcases our central concept of TV (the antenna) powered by the fans (the people). The wordmark features a minimal design with shades of black to not distract from the content.

## Designing It
![Palette](/img/news/palette.png)
For the design, I used our brand colors of purple and orange chosen from Google's Material Design Palette. All of them are used on the site, but the logo only uses these four:
- Primary
- Accent
- Secondary text
- Divider color

The people have a slight shadow to raise it from the antenna and finish the antenna's circle (symbolizing connecting with others over the channel). The center person is colored in Primary and the other two are in Accent. The antenna has a gradient angled at 50 degrees of Accent to Primary.

The words are equal height with Pravox being in Secondary text and not as wide as Networks which is using Divider color. Also, the slant on a's stem is parallel to t's. The font is Nova Round.

## Station Specific Logos
For the individual station logos, a few things change. First, the Antenna gradient and center person changes purple to the specific station brand color. Secondly, Networks is replaced with the station name in ALL CAPS using the brand color. Lastly, the Pravox wordmark is made smaller in height and width than the station brand.
