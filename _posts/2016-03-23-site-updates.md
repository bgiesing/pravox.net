title: "Pravox Update: Same but Different!"
---

Hey guys! So it's been a while since I talked about Pravox so here's some updates!

# Site Revamp
Did you notice anything different about the post? Well, it's actually pretty hard to tell but I migrated the site from Mozello's hosting platform to a static site.

What does this mean for you?
1. Faster site because it's not doing heavy lifting behind the scenes.
2. More secure as it's hosted through GitHub Pages and now has HTTPS!
3. Domain! So before I had the site domain (pravox.net) redirecting to Mozello's page because they didn't allow custom URLs. Now there's no redirect (which also helps the above 2 points).

I'm still tweaking some things so if anything looks "broken", please contact me at me@brandongiesing.com

# Pravox YOU
Our own hosted platform didn't really work as nobody wants to sign up for accounts (can you blame them?). I'm currently in the process of examining other platforms but most require signup. However, some can be signed up with existing accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Also almost every one is "music-oriented" which could be confusing.

Here's what I'm considering:
- Dubtrack.fm
  - Music oriented but with loads of existing account support
- Musiqpad
  - Combination between me hosting but with the abilty for people to log in and discover through their site (so a mix of what we have currently and any of the other platforms)
- Cytu.be
  - Same platform we use but shared and hosted by the platform creator. This has the benefit of the current experence but gaining more people. Still requires login though but the login is valid for any channel on their site.
- BeatSense
  - Music-oriented, Only Facebook and Email Login but has a unique function to play past-added stuff when nobody is online to add anything. This means you always have something to watch and (since it will jump back to new stuff the second something is submitted) means that the auto-playlist won't keep you waiting for hours on end.

In the meanwhile, we are sticking to our platform but if you know of any better options, contact me also!
