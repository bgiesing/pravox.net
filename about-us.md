# About Us
Welcome to Pravox Networks, a station group of free, independent, and FCTV stations!

## What is FCTV?
FCTV stands for Fan-Controlled TV! Our stations are programmed by **YOU** meaning what's played is reflective of your fellow watchers! If you want more of something, just add it! If you don't like something, thumbs it down and if enough people agree, it will be instantly removed.

## Topics are key!
A key component of our stations are the focus on specific topic groups. Yes we have a traditional all-in-one channel for anything but the topic-specific channels are the shining star. They allow people to get engaged with more technical ideas and communicate with people who share common interests.

## Always Free
By being free and online, we don't have to pay fees or limit content to support ad companies. However, we still have costs! First the domain name for the homepage is $12/year and the hosting is $72/year. Add a bit of padding for life and we have $100 per year. Our goal of $500 is for 5 years or less with room for new projects that may add more costs.
